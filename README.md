# flickr-show : A Simple Flickr Photo Slide Show In Google Gadget

This is a simple Google Gadget that I have developed for a website for a none-profit organization, the
[Ann-Hua Rainbow Project] (http://rainbow.annhua.org/). It was first written a few years ago.

An example of this gadget may be find on [this AHRP page](http://rainbow.annhua.org/).

This gadget is hosted on a Google Sites file cabinet, so it may be used with this URL if you don't want to host your own copy:


  https://sites.google.com/site/ahrp1998/flickr-show/flickr-show.xml

However, not sure is Google's policy regarding hosting these gadgets out of Google Sites, so that may
have to change in the future.

To use this gadget, a Flickr API Key is needed which may be obtained from Flickr for free.
